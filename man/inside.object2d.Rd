\title{Returns a logical vector for whether the 2D positions given in 'x' are inside the object specified by 'object', 'center', 'angle' and 'par'.}
\usage{
inside.object2d(x, object = c("ellipse", "rect"), par = c(1, 1),
  center = c(0, 0), angle = 0, logical = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{is a three column matrix representing the x- y- and z-coordinates. If x is a vector, it is considered to be one single 2D point.}

\item{object}{is string representing the type of object to use. Currently implemented are "ellipsoid" and "cuboid" (may be abbreviated).}

\item{par}{is a vector of three elements representing the semi axis lengths for ellipsoid and the x-width, y-depth and z-height of cuboid.}

\item{center}{is a vector of three elements representing the centre position of the object.}

\item{angle}{is the angle of the major axis of the ellipsoid in the x-y-plane, in the case that object=="ellipsoid".}

\item{logical}{is TRUE if the output should be locigal instead of numeric.}
